# Overtake AI - F1 Dashboard

## Overview

Overtake AI is a sophisticated F1 dashboard that leverages machine learning to provide real-time predictions and actionable advice to users. By processing live data, the application offers unique insights into race dynamics, helping users to understand and anticipate race outcomes.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the challenges and complexities found in computationally intensive careers. We aimed to create a tool that could not only handle and process large volumes of data in real-time but also translate that data into meaningful and accessible insights, much like the high-pressure, data-driven environments of modern-day professions.

## What it Does

* **Real-time Predictions:** Displays live predictions based on incoming race data.
* **User-Specific Advice:** Provides tailored advice and strategic recommendations to users.

## How We Built It

Overtake AI is a full-stack application built with a combination of web technologies and a powerful machine learning backend.

* **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Tailwind
* **Backend:** Python, Flask
* **Machine Learning:** Keras, TensorFlow, NumPy
* **Data Processing:** Jupyter Notebook, Python
* **Deployment:** Docker

## Challenges We Ran Into

One of the most significant hurdles we faced was data preprocessing. Cleaning, synchronizing, and preparing the real-time F1 data for our machine learning models proved to be a complex and iterative process that required a deep understanding of the data's nuances.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

We are particularly proud of our ability to cohesively connect imperfect, real-world data to actionable and insightful statements. Transforming raw telemetry and timing data into clear, concise, and useful advice for the end-user was a major achievement for our team.

## What We Learned

This project was a tremendous learning experience. We had the opportunity to apply calculus for data transformation, which was a novel approach for our team. Furthermore, juggling the demands of full-stack development within a tight timeline taught us a great deal about project management, team collaboration, and efficient development practices.
